        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The NBA is a very competitive industry in which 30 teams give their all out on the court all year, with only one champion.
            <br>    <br>   
            First, we'll identify the favorites through 4 different methods, and then we will see how often did they win and a little more.

        <h2>Identifying the favorites through different selection processes </h2>
        
        <p >
            To determine the favorite for the title, we will proceed through 4 different methods
        </p>
        <u><h4>Method 1</h4></u>
        <p>
            Favorite is the N°1 Seed in the league at the end of the regular season. The team with the most wins (or more if tied), and consider them the favorites for the coming playoffs.
            The idea is simple : the regular season should be the best way of finding the best basketball team. 82 games to prove your worth, you came on top, you should win it all.
        </p>
        <u><h4>Method 2</h4></u>
        <p>
            Favorite is the best ranked team, advanced ratings wise. Same reasoning, you had 82 games to prove your worth on offense and defense, and the numbers say you have the best mix.
            You should fear no one, since you have better ratings than them accross 82 games.
        </p>
        <u><h4>Method 3</h4></u>
        <p>
            Favorite is whoever Vegas deems favorite at the beginning of the season. If 2 or more teams are tied, both are deemed favorites. Let's see if people that are paid to get it right are more accurate than the actual sport they try to predict.
            What if the Vegas' pick wins more often than the N°1 seed ? Are bookmakers seeing the future ?
        </p>
        <u><h4>Method 4</h4></u>
        <p>
            Favorite is whoever Vegas deems favorite at the end of the season, before the 1st playoff game. Bookmakers have had 82 games to readjust their models and predictions, give them another chance
            to get it right, and see if they have better results.
        </p>
        <p><i>The Vegas odds have been taken from <a href="https://sportsoddshistory.com">sportsoddshistory.com</a>. Conclusions based on such data should therefore be taken with a grain of salt, 
            since accuracy and confidence in the numbers is quite low.</i> </p>

            Favorite before the season : Boston Celtics with a +310.
            <br>Are you bold enough to follow the best strategy and bet on the Celtics right now ? Will you wait to see who's the best placed team or the n°1 seed ?
